# wordle (JS)

Create a program, which, given a 5 character string as a target word, and a 5 character string as a guess, return a 5 character string where:
- ‘2’ = this letter is in this position
- ‘1’ = this letter is in the target word but not this position
- ‘0’ = this letter is either not in the target word, or is not in the targe

## Examples

### No matching characters
- Target = “ropes”
- Guess  = “child”
- Result = “00000”

### Characters match in correct positions
- Target = “alert”
- Guess  = “alarm”
- Result = “22020”

### Character in wrong position
- Target = “stair”
- Guess  = “chore”
- Result = “00010”

### Mix of match and wrong position
- Target = “hairy”
- Guess  = “charm”
- Result = “01120”

### Multiple characters in wrong positions
- Target = “reads”
- Guess  = “elect”
- Result = “10000”
